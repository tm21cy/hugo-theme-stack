*twilight loosens the sky with a silver unraveling,*\
*i step into the hush where our vows are born;*\
*each one flickers like a star on the edge of forgetting,*\
*fragile as the breath before a dream begins*\
*yet sure as the moon's hand closing over mine.*

*beloved, your breathing drifts into deepest silence;*\
*i give myself to guard the stillness that cradles you,*\
*my promise rising and falling with the tide of your chest,*\
*a fragile song stitched through the quiet threads of*\
*night, each pause a temple where i kneel to remain.*

*in secret, we are wed each night beneath the constellations,*\
*their glittering eyes the only witnesses we desire as*\
*our promises pass like whispers between shadows, spoken*\
*too softly for the day to overhear with its sharpest ears,*\
*erased the instant light rises to steal me from you.*

*with lips pressed to your sleeping hand, i resolve*\
*to love you as the tide loves the moon, encircling,*\
*then released; i whisper to your faintest touch*\
*to let the sun unlace us without sorrow or protest,*\
*to return me to you when the stars breathe us whole.*

*let my hand be your ring in the secrecy of our nights,*\
*our fingers knotted like ancient roots beneath the earth;*\
*i bind myself to you in the caverns of dreams,*\
*leaning so near as to feel your breath weaving into mine,*\
*scattering starlight across your brow, lest sleep divide us.*

*at dawn i thin like breath fading from a mirror,*\
*a trace vanishing before it can be carefully held;*\
*take this veil of promises, stitched from dusk, a fabric*\
*the morning can never wholly unravel, a covenant*\
*so uniquely ours, released into vanishing light.*

*already the vows falter upon my tongue; already*\
*sparrows gather to scatter them beyond your reach*\
*yet still i release them without hesitation, watching*\
*each dissolve as all our night-songs must always*\
*with the dark's thinning, the stars paling to ash.*

*with first light the sky unthreads my tongue; each*\
*dedication dissolves like dew sinking into grass*\
*while silence glimmers faintly beneath my ribs,*\
*a ghost of silver pressed against my heart, trembling*\
*toward the hour the stars bring me back to you.*

*and as dusk bends low with a silver crown, i return*\
*myself once more to the hush of your sleep; let vows*\
*perish, for i will remake them thread by thread*\
*upon the night's patient loom, until even the gods*\
*of forgetting lower their heads to our endless night.*
