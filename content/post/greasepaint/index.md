*you kissed me under paper stars,*\
*their seams disguised beneath limelight;*\
*for a heartbeat, i believed in forever -*\
*a script too fragile to bear the night's*\
*burden, a fabric unraveling in my grip.*

*i watched the corners of the set collapse*\
*yet begged the spotlight to linger still,*\
*to let each handcrafted star stay pinned*\
*above us, to trap us inside the rehearsed glow*\
*before the fiction slipped away again.*

*the silence swelled louder than any score,*\
*a desolate script grinding through my*\
*teeth; my voice fractured against the rafters,*\
*a shadow of myself still moving to each cue*\
*with a body reciting lines it never chose.*

*even still, i prayed for the reel to spool again -*\
*not for each light or polished scene, but*\
*for your hand reaching, grasping, through the*\
*dark, to the fragile illusions we cobbled*\
*into truth, the warmth of each falsehood.*

*your face flickered between smoke-filled frames,*\
*lines bleeding, smeared, across my trembling*\
*mouth; the painted set dissolved into melting*\
*walls as i reached for your palm's weight in mine*\
*and found only air, only wet paint.*

*when did each memory surrender to*\
*script, collapsing into facade and design?*\
*i mouthed each word as though they were*\
*mine, while the walls crumbled inward, trapping*\
*me inside a dream i could not abandon.*

*i pleaded incessantly for those lights to ignite,*\
*not to blind me, but to blur me in their glow;*\
*better the greasepaint, the written lies*\
*than waking to the silence that unmakes belief*\
*that nothing we once cradled could ever remain.*

*i clawed for a morsel of my own reflection in*\
*the backdrop, a memory not bound to cue or*\
*scene; what remains when the set is struck?*\
*an echo, a shadow, a nameless ghost*\
*drifting through the script's void?*

*atop these plaster hillsides, i reach again*\
*for those fragile paper stars stitched in limelight;*\
*their glow, too thin to last, haunts me, dismantles*\
*me, convinces me to cling to the crafted story*\
*as if fiction were suddenly worth believing.*
