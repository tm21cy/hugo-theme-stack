*they say the iron in our blood*\
*was forged in the depths of ancient stars;*\
*every quiet beat of my restless heart*\
*remembers the light of their fire,*\
*a distant glow still moving through us.*

*do the stars see their infinite reflection*\
*when our palms at last tenderly meet?*\
*is the stardust flowing in our veins,*\
*threaded far beyond all earthly imagination,*\
*a love between two celestial bodies?*

*i hear their breaths echo in the rhythm*\
*of your chest, each beat a memory of collapsed*\
*suns, dust carried across centuries to settle*\
*softly between us - the universe pleading as*\
*we cling tightly to this fragile, impermanent love.*

*what draws us closer is no cosmic riddle:*\
*we fall together as moons to planets to suns,*\
*our orbits authored long before we knew;*\
*love is the law of the stars above us,*\
*echoed in the rosy flush of our cheeks.*

*in the crooked turn of your giddy smile,*\
*constellations rearrange in real time;*\
*in the faintest whisper of your lips against mine,*\
*galaxies fold themselves small enough*\
*to rest in the impossible space between.*

*the blue beneath your wrist reminds me*\
*even when stars burn out, their dust endures -*\
*so too does every trace of love, every glimmer*\
*of your golden hair in fleeting sunlight, each*\
*moment i choose to leave a piece of myself with you.*

*and still, i fear the silences between us,*\
*as wide and cold as the gulfs between galaxes,*\
*yet the pull of your eager eyes steadies me,*\
*gravity refusing to let me drift away,*\
*to lose our spark to that horizon of dark.*

*you are never small, my love, no matter how*\
*the world may tell you so - you carry galaxies*\
*folded into your quiet soul, your voice a honey-sweet*\
*reminder that the universe chose to gather in your*\
*smile, that the gods of creation favored you.*\

*and though the universe leans toward unraveling,*\
*all stars destined to invariably burn into silence,*\
*our love is a quiet defiance, a record of the way*\
*i chose to held you close, seeking order,*\
*praising the patterns in the dark i once despised.*
