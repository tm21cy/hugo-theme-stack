*love first appeared in your voice, gentler*\
*than the faintest evening wind, a thread*\
*slipping through the curtains of my window;*\
*i thought the flutter of a heart belonged*\
*only to lovers, to fools, to fantasy.*

*to sit beside you was to learn how*\
*patience rests like delicate rays of light on skin,*\
*how affection does not rush but settles*\
*into the quiet hollows of the ordinary with*\
*pause, daring each breath to linger.*

*so it was that i came to love you in time, falling*\
*for a voice, a smile, the way sleep overtakes*\
*our bodies: slowly, delicately, then all at once,*\
*as though the universe itself cradled my heart,*\
*pleading that my eager soul would learn surrender.*

*and still, the careful threads of love move outward;*\
*they linger in the echoes of laughter around weathered*\
*tables, in the way knowing eyes meet across*\
*a crowded room, and settle around me like*\
*a hand on my shoulder when words fall away.*

*'i'm in love with you', you said once, and in those*\
*simplest words i heard more than a confession*\
*to the stars; i heard the exuberant bravery of one*\
*who refuses to let truth remain unspoken,*\
*who savors its defiance in saying it plain.*

*i have since measured my days not in the weight*\
*of calendars fading on the wall, but by the gifts*\
*folded into a letter, by those in a silence shared,*\
*a sky too vast to conquer alone yet wide enough*\
*to explore in the welcome company of compassion.*

*if clocks insist on ticking, let them measure*\
*not hours but the nearness of our fleeting breath,*\
*the hush suspended in the space of our*\
*mingled air, where love gathers softly like a quilt*\
*in the slow unravelling of our fingers, intertwined.*

*i've come to see love not as a flame standing alone*\
*but as a hearth, the table where strangers gather,*\
*each chair left warm from the weight of someone's*\
*passing, the mantle lined with photos once too dear*\
*to risk, their dust brushed gently with patient hands.*

*each one reminds me to love, to cherish, even under*\
*the strain of the world undone; to love with courage,*\
*slowly, then all at once, with the ease of breathing*\
*truths once withheld, the flame lapping close as if*\
*to pull me back, remind me what waits undone.*
