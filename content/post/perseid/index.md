*they say the heliades cried tears of amber\
when phaethon was struck down;\
is that why august's meteors\
streak so fiercely outside my window?*

*each fire trail paints the pre-dawn sky,\
a wake of grief\
trailing a dreamer like me.*

*a man so confident in his dreaming,\
caution long-lost to the wind\
and pride a balm for the soul;\
yet, even in hubris,\
the world wept for him.*

*each streak a quiet verdict,\
cast from a court older than constellations;\
i lie still under their judgement,\
unsure if fire is my blessing\
or my sentence.*

*gazing toward tears of old,\
i wonder if i deserve the same sky,\
or if my fall will come without witness.*

*perhaps the world weeps only for those\
who dare to blaze as they fall;\
who shed their regrets with a wild laugh\
and stagger, living each day as their last.*

*do i stumble through life\
as phaethon did, piloting my own chariot\
fueled by a distant dream\
i can never cradle in both hands?*

*do i demand proof i lived\
like a son begging for his name,\
racing through my years with a dim hope\
that tears of amber may be cried for me?*

*or do i take the skies with a lust for living,\
wielding fire that may burn the heavens\
atop a chariot destined to freeze?*

*i point my camera to those fiery streaks,\
capturing a flicker of cosmic history,\
the most confident hubris i've ever known,\
mind wandering to the day the heliades\
decide whether my brief light was worth their grief.*
