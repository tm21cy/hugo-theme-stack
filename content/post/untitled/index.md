*the glass stands between us,\
polished to a mirror, patient in waiting.\
i press my palms to the panes, sudden courage\
met with indifference, a reminder\
of a dare i can't win.*

*the glass keeps my voice thin,\
each plea returned as hollow reverberation;\
as if to scold, it hisses back:\
"you don't want what waits out there,"\
swallowing me whole into its dull drone.*

*the glass teaches me stillness;\
no cracks to prod, no doors to open,\
a silent dwelling where i lean my ear\
hoping for a knock, a glance, a call,\
someone to peer in and witness my ruin.*

*the glass teaches me avoidance,\
a stern eye cast from my own reflection;\
i slink to corners, shrink to outskirts,\
revel in the safety of obscurity,\
content to remain unseen.*

*the glass turns to a shield;\
if no one sees me, no one wounds me.\
if no one touches me, no one leaves me.\
if no one reads me, no one remakes me.\
i call it safety, though it tastes of rust.*

*the glass begins to whisper my name,\
a dim echo promising a false sanctuary;\
its walls widen into chambers of reflection,\
yet i mistake their emptiness for comfort,\
a haven, a harbor, for weathering the storm.*

*the glass tells me i need no one else and\
i believe it, a shapeless friend who never demands;\
its stagnant air a blanket i cradle,\
its voice repeating soft as breath:\
"stay here, i'm all you need."*

*the glass becomes the keeper of dreams,\
the only compassion i dare request; me\
and my glass room dissolve the noise,\
the chatter, the laughter, the world outside,\
and the self who might have broken it down.*
