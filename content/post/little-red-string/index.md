*for over twenty years, i've asked myself why\
the little red string around my little finger must haunt my thoughts.*

*i fiddle with it while i sit,\
tying knots or braiding the slack.\
the string blows in the wind like any other string,\
gets wet in the rain like any other string,\
and accompanies me as i fall asleep,\
as if to simply say, endlessly, "soon."*

*why does it hold onto me,\
like a vice, clamping on my conscience?\
or do i hold on to the string instead,\
feeling the hum of its strands under my fingertips,\
a tether to life and love not yet realized?*

*i think about the string a lot, probably more than it's worth\
questioning the way it moves,\
the quivers at night,\
its dance under a too-bright sun,\
and its stillness when winter's chill sets in.*

*i've chased that string to each end of the earth,\
waiting, calling out, for the fateful pull,\
the tug, as if to say "you're nearly there."*

*the string frays as i travel,\
the tension nigh-palpable,\
until i find myself yearning for the pull.*

*i've tried to sever it,\
to cut my losses and mourn the inevitable passage of time;\
"what good are fateful meetings, anyway?"\
it never loosens, never breaks, never tangles\
never quite escapes me - always a whisper to stay anchored,\
a reminder of all that makes me human.*

*i run my fingers up and down the string,\
shimmy it around my finger,\
lament over the tan lines it leaves, subtle reminders of a love i donâ€™t yet have,\
a memory of all left undone, all i didn't chase,\
a simple wish to learn more about the one on the other side.*

*does the string tremble late at night\
by the laughter of friends\
or by the tears of someone hopelessly searching?*

*does the string dance on a bright summer day\
by the sway of a cool breeze\
or by the sprints of a yearning lover towards me?*

*and does it still during the winter nights\
as the inevitability of time's passage sets in\
or because of a warm fire, a hot mug, and warm company?*

*i flick the string\
it ripples, calling out to whoever may be on the other end:\
i'm here\
i'm waiting\
come find me*
