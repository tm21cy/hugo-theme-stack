*“imagine if we could interact with each other only to turn back the clock and forget the bad parts!”*

*my professor says, as we sit in the same weekly office discussing research ideas.*

*we called it “non-causal conversation”,*

*the notion that there are intrinsically good things for machines to learn through conversation,*

*while there is potential for them to forget the bad if we tell them to.*

*we insisted that the strings of fate that bind us to our metaphorically sorrowful captors of time could be severed with the click of a button – in the name of research.*

*the thought nagged at me for so long:*

*a brilliant research idea, but something morally ambiguous,*

*something that almost felt like robbing those of the future of the authentic human condition.*

*it was like a twisted predestination, to never be able to say*

*“if i had known then what i know now, it’d be different.”*

*the more i sit on the idea, the more i wish to be able to stare that same machine in the eyes,*

*telling it through more than words*

*that there’s necessity in not having known.*

*i like to imagine that i’m sharing a swing set with this machine;*

*the swing set where i lamented to friends about petty drama,*

*or the swing set where i first felt love,*

*or the swing set where i first mourned the passing of time.*

*i would attempt to convince it that this spot upon which we rest has no meaning to me or it once you erase what it sits on the shoulders of,*

*because how do you impart learned wisdom without learning?*

*how do you impart love’s joy without the feeling of love’s sorrow?*

*how do you impart the congeniality of friendship without knowing what it means to need a reunion?*

*how do you not feel sorrowful every time you envision the good, and how do you not feel good every time you envision the sorrowful?*

*the machine, of course, wouldn’t react to my lamenting, but i’d continue.*

*i would tell it stories of how*

*“if i had known i was going to succeed, i wouldn’t have beaten myself up over minor failures.”*

*“if i had known i would feel hopelessly devoted to companionship, i would have loved stronger.”*

*“if i had known they’d leave me so soon, i would have made an effort to be better friends.”*

*as i would lament to this machine, i’d pour out my thesis of how scrubbing a being of their negative past throttles all emotional growth.*

*i would realize that there was a nuanced joy in not knowing, and a profound happiness in having failed.*

*i would finally come to terms with the fact that having been less of me implies a greater version of me.*

*the same machine would likely stare at me, lifeless, complicit in my not-so-shared soapbox about the human condition, without realizing that, crucially,*

*sorrow bred desire,*

*desire bred motivation,*

*and motivation bred sorrow.*
