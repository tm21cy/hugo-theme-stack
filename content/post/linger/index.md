*the platform hums beneath my feet as i*\
*blink - doors shuttering, windows pulling*\
*you into the dark; my hand spreads against*\
*cold glass, a futile bridge, a gesture unraveling,*\
*grasping, still, at what i know to be gone.*

*each step through the small town carried*\
*the leap of a blink, the caf√© blurring into*\
*street, the street into station, the station*\
*into memory fading in color*\
*of the living i once desperately wished away.*

*i wave, i laugh, i pinch myself only*\
*to slow the reel - pinning frames in place,*\
*the film sputtering, jumping forward,*\
*the gift of the moment torn open,*\
*discarded before its breath is known.*

*the garden gate swung shut, though i*\
*never felt my hand upon it; the clink*\
*of weathered metal echoes in tenderness,*\
*a moment already hollowed, swiftly lost,*\
*missed as though it were never mine.*

*arguments, quiet evening, the clatter*\
*of unwashed dishes, echoes that bloom in*\
*memory, reflections of a brighter self,*\
*the one who longed for the world yet*\
*fought desperately to slow its forward pull.*

*the city's night sky conspires with time;*\
*i blink, and the skyline tilts again, a*\
*stranger's face eclipsing yours in bluish glass -*\
*the world's insistence carries me into the*\
*next dissolve, frame by frame.*

*i carry every ache, every sharp whisper,*\
*contraband pressed beneath the ribs i bruised*\
*watching fireworks scatter above that field;*\
*the memory ripens into sweetness only*\
*in the instant it is ripped from my keeping.*

*if leaving bends me, it is only because*\
*the days before, so feather-light they almost*\
*vanished, lifted and cradled me through hours*\
*i now sew into quilts of imagination, warmth*\
*gathered in each patch, comfort-cut to my shape.*

*how lucky i am to leave in tears; the same*\
*tears soaking papers, your shirt, my pillow -*\
*the world tilts forward, insisting on its way,*\
*even the dullest days returning with the faintest*\
*trace of light, of who i was, who i loved to be.*
