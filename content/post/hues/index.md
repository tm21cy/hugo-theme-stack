*red, they say, is the color of love,\
a hue that hums with quiet passion\
of meet-cutes through a mutual friend\
or coworkers who deny the obvious spark.*

*i color love with the flowers outside my front door;\
a garden never blooms in red alone\
and we'd be damned to ignore the vividity\
of blues, greens, yellows, and whites.*

*for instance, why not see love as the blue\
of that first night we met — awkward laughter,\
sushi rolls left half-eaten among friends,\
twilight leaning closer with every word,\
the sky darkening, yet endless?*

*i remember the first day i called love green,\
when your emerald eyes met mine\
with a steadiness i hadn't known;\
the gaze that told me, for the first time,\
"you're okay. i've got you."*

*yellow was the sundress you wore —\
the radiance of your smile, startling as the dawn,\
the moment i wondered if i came only for friendship,\
for idle chatter, or for 3am texts\
that betrayed the idea of "best friends."*

*and sure, red has crossed my mind,\
the vibrant hue of your lips first pressed to mine,\
the color of the flush in my cheeks betraying me as i wondered\
if i'd thrown away the first good thing i dared to hold\
for the sake of my own desires.*

*grey, too, had its place —\
the silence after squabbles, the fog\
that lingered until your hand found mine again;\
grey, the resilient shade of what i hadn't yet lost\
even when my own light felt distant.*

*your breath, warm against my chest\
makes even this weary world bearable;\
a goofy smile curling in your sleep\
as you shift beneath the blankets,\
something color can't quite describe.*

*and those nights on park benches —\
laughter sweetened past its measure,\
compliments heavier in their meaning,\
two people pretending not to notice\
what every color already knew.*

*so don't blame me too much\
if the white of your wedding dress\
contradicts red as the color of love —\
i've learned to love you as i love a garden,\
a mosaic of hues stumbled upon and cherished,\
a desire that outlasts the seasons.*
