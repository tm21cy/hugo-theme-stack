*what is grief, if not the warmth of your hand*\
*on mine, "be brave" trailing from your lips*\
*that gave a faltering smile - your last vow of love*\
*i was drunk on, as i reached for the final*\
*echo of a spark fading in your eyes?*

*what is grief, if not the hollow of my passenger*\
*seat; your blue sunglasses still hooked on the mirror,*\
*casting shards of light across the console, the radio*\
*echoing your voice, soft and off-key, as we*\
*once drove toward our perfect nowhere?*

*what is grief, if not the basket of laundry hastily*\
*left atop your empty place in our bed, each shirt*\
*carrying marshmallows and lavender, the scent of*\
*the love i cannot bring myself to release,*\
*each article untouched, as if to hold reality still?*

*what is grief, if not the cloudless day outside*\
*my window, the vast sky collapsing beneath*\
*your absence, a book left open, a receipt marking*\
*the page, our deck chairs echoing with*\
*your last complaint about a story too slow?*

*what is grief, if not my hands clasped together,*\
*a desperate prayer to the deities of memory,*\
*my calloused palms aching for the silk of yours*\
*as i squeeze firmly, waiting for the ghost of your reply,*\
*haunted by the breath you once drew from me?*

*what is grief, if not the vacant silence of*\
*the kitchen, my body aching for your arms*\
*around me from behind, your whisper sending*\
*shivers down my neck, along my spine, while you*\
*rubbed sleep from your eyes with a shameless grin?*

*what is grief, if not the face of your brother,*\
*his gaze bloodshot, bearing the same ache,*\
*my chest tightening as your smile returns*\
*unbidden through him, the love you left still*\
*glimmering in the eyes of those who remain?*

*and grief remains in the unspoken fury*\
*of "she was a beautiful soul, she lit up each room,"*\
*as if their faces could ever understand*\
*the way you tenderly cradled my heart,*\
*how your eyes once found mine in any room?*

*so what is grief, if not love left unfinished -*\
*your life, our life, stranded in the ink*\
*of an author reaching for the next chapter;*\
*a heart once as bright as the wildflowers*\
*extinguished beneath the snow where you kissed me last?*
