*we had only a season\
but it burned brighter in being brief;\
mornings stretched golden with your laughter,\
flowers in my window swayed in our shared breaths,\
with you, even the rain turned gentle.*

*in each coffee date, each train ride, each smile,\
there was a pocket of eternity;\
i sought the shape of your hand,\
my thumb tracing the quiet ridges of your knuckles,\
as if holding on could break the cycle of time.*

*yet the days kept unfolding, steady and sure,\
the edges marred by shadows we never named;\
we gathered joy as though it might be endless,\
each moment bottled like the fireflies you loved,\
even as forever quietly passed us by.*

*as distance spoke your name,\
you chose a path i could not follow;\
i smiled watching you go,\
and i never reached to hold you back —\
love does not build cages.*

*what we held remains untarnished,\
a chamber in my mind, the quiet cavern of the soul;\
yet my hands ache with emptiness\
in the absence of the one i loved,\
the crisp spring air wide as the world.*
